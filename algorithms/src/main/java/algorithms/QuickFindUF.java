/**
 * The {@code QuickFindUF} class is an implementation of the {@link UF}
 * interface with constant time operation {@link #find(int)} (hence the name
 * <em>quick find</em>).
 *
 * <p>
 * In accordance with the specification of {@link UF} interface, the set of
 * <em>n</em> objects are represented as integers from 1 to <em>n - 1</em> and
 * each component is identified by an integer between 1 and <em>n - 1</em>.
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation of {@code QuickFindUF} uses an {@code int} array to
 * store the <em>component identifier</em> of each object. The component
 * identifier of an object is the identifier of the component to which the
 * object belongs. Two objects are in the same component iff they have the same
 * component identifier. Initially, each object is in its own component. That
 * is, object <em>i</em> has a component identifier <em>i</em>. The
 * implementation also stores the number of components in an {@code int}
 * variable.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code find(p)} returns the component identifier of {@code p}. Time
 * complexity: {@code O(1)}.</li>
 *   <li>{@code union(p, q)} changes those component identifiers which equal to
 * the component identifier of {@code p} into the component identifier of
 * {@code q} and then decreases the number of components by one. Time
 * complexity: {@code O(n)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * For more information, see Section 1.5 of <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i>.
